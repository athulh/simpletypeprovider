TypeProvider
=============

I'm not going to call this a real DI framework or an IoC Container because you have to request the dependencies in each class you want them in. But, it does take the construction of the instances away from you. 

And, now it comes with added awesomeness, it will complete the dependencies down the line for you. Hopefully.

I'm making this library for use on what will initially be an Android application then Windows Phone and maybe iOS.
